# sgApi

sgApi provides a simple wrapper around the NOMIS and Open Geography Portal APIs. 


The key functionality offered is:

1. Takes a geometry and returns the constituencies in contact with that shape
2. Allows lookups between commonly used boundary scales
3. Returns results from queries of datasets
4. Returns overview of tables
